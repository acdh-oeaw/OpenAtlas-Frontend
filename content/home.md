<strong>Mapping Medieval Conflicts (MEDCON). A digital approach towards political dynamics in
the pre-modern period</strong>

MEDCON was funded within the go!digital-programme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OEAW) from
October 2014 to May 2017 and hosted at the Institute for Medieval Research of OEAW The project
headed by Johannes Preiser-Kapeller examined the explanatory power of concepts of social and spatial
network analysis for phenomena of political conflict in medieval societies.

The data presented in this demo version stems from two of MEDCON´s case studies,
“Emperor Frederick III and the League of the Mailberger coalition in 1451/52”
(executed by Kornelia Holzner-Tobisch and Petra Heinicker) and “Factions and alliances in the fight
of Maximilian I for Burgundy” (Sonja Dünnebeil).
